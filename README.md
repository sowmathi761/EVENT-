Ah, got it Sowmathi — thanks for clarifying! 😊

Since this is **your first project** and it **only contains the HTML file (and the image)**, we can make a **simple, clean README** that is perfect for beginners and professional enough for GitHub.

Here’s a **minimal README.md** for your repo:

---

# Art Gallery Website

## Overview

This is my **first HTML project** — a simple Art Gallery website.
It displays an art exhibition with a heading, description, and an image of the gallery.

---

## Features

* Single-page website using **HTML**
* Displays an art gallery image
* Includes event description and contact details

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**

---

## Live Demo

You can view the website here:
[Art Gallery Website](https://sowmathi761.github.io/EVENT-/)

---

## Project Structure

```
EVENT-/
├── index.html
├── Art gallery 1.png
└── README.md
```

* `index.html` → Main webpage
* `Art gallery 1.png` → Displayed image
* `README.md` → This file

---

## How to View Locally

1. Download or clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sowmathi761/EVENT-.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in any web browser

---

This **keeps it simple** and professional for your **first project**.

If you want, I can also make it **look slightly more attractive for GitHub**, like adding headings, bold text, and better formatting so it stands out in your profile.

Do you want me to do that?
